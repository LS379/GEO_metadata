GEO is a public functional genomics data repository supporting MIAME-compliant data submissions. 
Array- and sequence-based data are accepted. Tools are provided to help users query and download experiments and curated gene expression profiles.

In order to have an overview of the projects from GEO Database, I created a script for converting metadata into simple graphics.
